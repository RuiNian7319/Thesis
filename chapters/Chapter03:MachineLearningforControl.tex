% 1. Reinforcement learning Q-learning algorithm
%  - Extension to of tabular methods to continuous processes using interpolation
%  - Can be extended further using neighbourhood information
% 2. Continuous control using deep reinforcement learning
% 3. Comparison of results with MPC on simple systems
% 4. Fault tolerant RL vs. traditional methods
