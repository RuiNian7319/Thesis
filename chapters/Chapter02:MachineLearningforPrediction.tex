Cheap data storage and escalation of computational power allowed the world to enter a new age: the age of \textit{big data}. With vast amounts of data, previously in-viable and data hungry machine learning algorithms are now implementable.  The technology sector was the first group to be able to exploit this arcane technology to create tremendous value in applications ranging from targeted advertisements to self driving cars. The value was so great that the current top four companies in America by market capitalization are all technology companies (Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Facebook) as of 2019. As the technology sector's successes grow, other industries begin to catch a glimpse of the potential value creation in their own respective industries.  Alas, investments into machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) begins for all industries.

ML solutions promise to be cheaper, more accurate, and have online learning abilities compared to traditional methods.  Additionally, the solutions are promised to be easier to implement and will take less time to design; feed it data and it will learn, as they claim.  With this mentality, machine learning engineers and practitioners from technology companies attempted to conquer other industries, one being the process control and chemical engineering field. their ideas about cats, etc...

Talk about how the methods are applied to process industry, compared to other places like cat classification.  Things such as time delay, type of model (steady state or dynamic), etc. that are unique to process control.

- Largest customer is probably soft sensors, training, and planning for management.

The objective of this section is to convey ideas for implementing machine learning solutions catered towards the \textbf{process control} industry.  In this chapter

The machine learning methods were then applied to the prediction and optimization of an industrial pipeline\footnote{This project was supported in part by Mitacs through the Mitacs Accelerate program.}. This chapter only contains the theory, application, and highlights. The detailed industrial project report can be found in Appendix A.
