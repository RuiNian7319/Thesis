\section{Introduction to the Optimal Control Problem}

\section{Motivation and Challenges}

Thinking out loud:
- RL introduction (Chapter 3 atm)
    - Introduce MDP in the middle of it (Chapter 2 atm)

- MPC introduction (Chapter 4 atm)

\section{Thesis Outline and Contributions}
The thesis is organized as follows.  First, optimal control via RL and MPC will be compared on simple SISO, SIMO, MISO, and MIMO systems.  Then, both RL and MPC will be applied to an industrial waste water treatment plant for optimization and optimal control. Here, the advantages and disadvantages of each strategy will be comprehensively explored.
