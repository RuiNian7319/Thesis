\section{Introduction to Reinforcement Learning}

There are four classes of machine learning: i) Supervised Learning, ii) Unsupervised Learning, iii) Semi-supervised learning, iv) Reinforcement learning.  Supervised learning fits a model to a labeled data set.  In the ideal case, the fitted model can predict all data correctly.  Subsequently, unsupervised learning is used on unlabeled data sets.  The objective of unsupervised learning is to explore the data and identify hidden features. Semi-supervised learning combines supervised and unsupervised learning to form a model.  This class of machine learning is especially useful
