Heavily unbalanced data:
- SMOTE, ADASYN, Breaking time down into smaller segments and increasing sampling rate

\subsubsection{Classification}
The model structure for logistic regression is given as:
\begin{equation}
    \hat{y} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(W_1^Tx + W_2^Tu + b)}}
    \label{eq:02LogS}
\end{equation}
